/*
 * 3. Tabs
 *
 * TASK: Tab interfaces are commmon when we want selective disclosure of larger
 * sections of information, often  some kind of logical sub-divison of the program.
 * Your task is to make a simple tabbed interface that consits of two parts:
 *
 * 1. A "tab bar" of triggers.
 * 2. A panel with the content of the open tab.
 *
 * Clicking on a tigger in the tab bar should correspondingly show the
 * correct content in the panel. Unlike the disclorsure and accordion widget
 * we have made before, the tab introduces a layer of indirection. It is not
 * really possible to keep the trigger and the panel in the same element.
 * The trigger bar is displayed at all times, where as the panel is shifting.
 * In order to make this work, you will need to introduce some kind of indirect
 * linking between the tab and the panel. There are muntiple ways of doing this,
 * but I will show you how we can get and set custom HTML attributes.
 *
 * This exercise is presented as a "fill in the blanks", but you could also
 * try to do it from scratch if you feel adventurous.
